# StockNewsApp
App sends daily sms with information on specified stock. Includes market movement and news articles. 
Requires stock of interest, receiver phone nr. Also requires a sender nr. I've used Twilio. 
Uses three different APIs. Alpha Vantage for stock data, requires API key. News API for stock news, also requires API key. Twilio for sms capability and sender phone nr, requires account sid and auth token.
